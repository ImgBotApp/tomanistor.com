      <title>Starting with Vue.js</title>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a little indecisive on which JavaScript framework or library to dive into next. Based on all of the job descriptions I&amp;rsquo;ve been plowing through, any front-end and even most full-stack web development roles require proficiency with a number of different JavaScript frameworks.
Vanilla JavaScript is Not Enough A lot of advice directed at junior web developers that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across online stresses the importance of mastering JavaScript before attempting to level up with frameworks.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Toma Nistor, a full stack web developer and UI/UX enthusiast with a digital marketing and SEO background based in San Diego, California. Since creating my first website at the age of twelve, my eyes have been glued to the web. What was once only a long-time hobby, has now become my full-time career.
After spending two years as a digital marketer and trying to teach myself web development in my spare time, I decided to dive into an intensive four-month Ruby on Rails coding bootcamp at LEARN academy.</description>

      <title>Cache Bust that Asset</title>

      <description>Static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and image files are normally cached for long periods of time with expiry periods of a few weeks or months after being served to a user&amp;rsquo;s web browser. Caching is used to speed up a website or application by once downloading a file and storing a cached version of it in the browser. When a user moves from page to page on a website or revisits the same site in the future, the cached file is served automatically without wasting any time loading the same file.</description>

      <description>CloudFlare is a free content delivery network (CDN) that helps deliver static content quickly and efficiently throughout the world. Caching and serving static content through dependable CDNs like CloudFlare, MaxCDN, or AWS CloudFront can help speed up your website drastically.
 A CDN is essentially a network of geographically dispersed servers. Each CDN node (also called Edge Servers) caches the static content of a site like the images, CSS/JS files and other structural components.</description>

      <description>The Hugo workflow is fairly simple and straightforward. This is the workflow I use to update and operate this blog and portfolio.
Inside of your Hugo project folder, the public/ folder is generated with all of your static site files once hugo is run in the terminal.
Purge and Serve To generate a new public/ folder, just remove the existing one and run the server. All updates you have made to your content and theme are now available in the new public/ folder and visible on the live server.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally ditching Wordpress and testing out new waters with Hugo, the static site generator written in Go. Go is a speedy programming language developed by Google.
During this new chapter of my career as a web developer, I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving away from dynamically generated site builders and constructing my new portfolio from the ground up in order to practice and refine my web developing skills with JavaScript, Go, and SCSS.</description>
