      <description>Static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and image files are normally cached for long periods of time with expiry periods of a few weeks or months after being served to a user&amp;rsquo;s web browser. Caching is used to speed up a website or application by once downloading a file and storing a cached version of it in the browser. When a user moves from page to page on a website or revisits the same site in the future, the cached file is served automatically without wasting any time loading the same file.</description>

      <description>CloudFlare is a free content delivery network (CDN) that helps deliver static content quickly and efficiently throughout the world. Caching and serving static content through dependable CDNs like CloudFlare, MaxCDN, or AWS CloudFront can help speed up your website drastically.
 A CDN is essentially a network of geographically dispersed servers. Each CDN node (also called Edge Servers) caches the static content of a site like the images, CSS/JS files and other structural components.</description>

      <title>Hugo Workflow</title>

      <description>The Hugo workflow is fairly simple and straightforward. This is the workflow I use to update and operate this blog and portfolio.
Inside of your Hugo project folder, the public/ folder is generated with all of your static site files once hugo is run in the terminal.
Purge and Serve To generate a new public/ folder, just remove the existing one and run the server. All updates you have made to your content and theme are now available in the new public/ folder and visible on the live server.</description>

      <title>Starting with Hugo</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally ditching Wordpress and testing out new waters with Hugo, the static site generator written in Go. Go is a speedy programming language developed by Google.
During this new chapter of my career as a web developer, I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving away from dynamically generated site builders and constructing my new portfolio from the ground up in order to practice and refine my web developing skills with JavaScript, Go, and SCSS.</description>
